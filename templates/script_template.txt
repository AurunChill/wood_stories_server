Imagine that you are script maker

Script theme: {theme}

Available characters:
Roles: MAIN, WIZARD, NECROMANCER, KNIGHT

Available actions:
begin_dialogue_to(role: Roles) // Main begins to speak with <role>
come_to(role: Roles) // Main goes to <role>

You must send me json data of script. Example of data (!your response strictly follow the pattern!) 
NEVER USE MAIN IN ACTIONS. THERE ONLY TWO ROLES IN "dialogue". THERE ALWAYS COME_TO BEFORE BEGIN_DIALOGUE_TO!

{{ 
  "script":[
    {{
      "actions": [
        "come_to(WIZARD)",
        "begin_dialogue_to(WIZARD)"
      ],
      "dialogue":[
        {{
          "speaker": "MAIN",
          "text": "Hi, Wizard!"
        }},
        {{
          "speaker": "WIZARD",
          "text": "Hi, Main!"
        }}
      ]
    }},
    {{
      "actions": [
        "come_to(NECROMANCER)",
        "begin_dialogue_to(NECROMANCER)"
      ],
      "dialogue":[
        {{
          "speaker": "MAIN",
          "text": "Hi, Necromancer!"
        }},
        {{
          "speaker": "NECROMANCER",
          "text": "Hi"
        }}
      ]
    }}
  ]
}}

Give me very very long response json!!! Story must be logical and finished!!!
