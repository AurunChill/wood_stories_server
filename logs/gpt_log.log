Script theme: Main asks wizard about necormancer

Available characters:
Roles: MAIN, WIZARD, NECROMANCER, KNIGHT

Available actions:
begin_dialogue_to(role: Roles) // Main begins to speak with <role>
come_to(role: Roles) // Main goes to <role>

You must send me json data of script. Example of data (!your response strictly follow the pattern!) 
NEVER USE MAIN IN ACTIONS. THERE ONLY TWO ROLES IN "dialogue". THERE ALWAYS COME_TO BEFORE BEGIN_DIALOGUE_TO!

    {
      "actions": [
        "come_to(WIZARD)",
        "begin_dialogue_to(WIZARD)"

      "dialogue":[
        {
          "speaker": "MAIN",
          "text": "Hi, Wizard!"
